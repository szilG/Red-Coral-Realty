                        <hr>
                        <h2>Description</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Exceptionally well restored waterfront Georgian property overlooking Glandore harbour.</p>
                        <p>Stone Hall unquestionably occupies one of the finest coastal settings in West Cork. Located adjacent to Glandore village, yet
                            commands an unrivalled elevated situation overlooking the harbour with breath-taking southerly views to Adam & Eve islands, the
                            coastline and ocean.</p>
                        <p>Originally built c. 1760, Stone Hall was completely renovated and extended in the early 1990's. This imposing house, along with The
                            Rectory and Seamark, forms a group of three distinct houses sharing similar design traits such as the advanced end bays. Stone Hall
                            appears to be the earliest house of the group, while the others were built by members of the Allen family within its grounds. The
                            grandeur of the house is accentuated by its raised location and prominent position. The residence, having undergone such a comprehensive
                            restoration encompassing major refurbishment to all facets of the building structure, is in excellent condition throughout marrying
                            the charm of a Georgian property with all the convenience of modern living. Great care was taken to enhance and retain its period features.</p>
                        <p>Stone Hall measuring approx. 5,000 sq. Ft (465 sq m) offers bright and airy accommodation of generous proportions. Upon entry it is remarkably
                            elegant, behind the large front door there is a beautifully proportioned entrance hall with stone flagged flooring, ceiling cornicing and a
                            wonderfully ornate ceiling rose.</p>
                        <p>The drawing room and dining room both have polished oak timber flooring, attractive marble chimney pieces with built-in gas fires and
                            splendid cornicing and ceiling roses.</p>
                        <p>At the western end, there is a warm and homely family day room with open hearth fireplace with wood burning stove, impressive windows,
                            large sliding door opening to sun terrace and polished timber floor. The kitchen/breakfast room is an elegant and welcoming space with door
                            leading to the walled garden and service hatch connecting to the dining room.</p>
                        <p>At the eastern end, there is a self-contained guest apartment including living room, kitchenette, bedroom and shower room.On the half landing,
                            there is an en-suite guest bedroom while the first floor comprises of the master bedroom suite including an en-suite
                            bathroom and dressing area. There are two more en-suite bedrooms on the same floor and all but one of the bedrooms take advantage of the
                            majestic coastal view. On the second floor, there are three further bedrooms and a separate family bathroom.</p>
                        <p>Approached by a private electronic gated entrance through an immaculate lawned garden, the drive slowly inclines to the front approach with
                            limestone steps leading to the front door and sun terrace. The gardens are a wonderful and particular feature of the property offering
                            stunning views over Glandore harbour including a summer house and a wide variety of temperate climate loving trees and shrubs leading down
                            to the edge of the property. Beyond the public road, there is significant water frontage.</p>
                        <p>Hidden to the rear of the house lies a most enchanting tiered garden with a beautiful curved wall encasing it. This walled garden has a sublime
                            aesthetic value but also retains its original and very valuable function: To raise the temperature of the garden and provide a more
                            protective environment for the plants within. The remainder of the grounds are laid out in woodland.</p>
                        <p>The location itself needs little introduction. Glandore (Harbour of the Oaks) is acclaimed as one of the most scenic villages in Ireland.
                            This much sought-after village is set in a superb position at the head of a spectacular natural wooded harbour and enjoys an easy-going
                            cosmopolitan atmosphere, with residents drawn from around the globe. The village has pubs and restaurants whilst the nearby fishing village
                            of Union Hall, reached across the iron harbour bridge, provides a shop as well as further restaurants and pubs. Glandore has a delightful
                            sheltered harbour with much year-round on the water activity including sailing school, sea angling, whale watching, rowing championships
                            and regattas.</p>
                        <p>Further along The Wild Atlantic Way, Skibbereen market town is circa 11 km away with extensive shopping and banking facilities and includes
                            a popular country market. Cork International Airport is approximately one hour distant. West Cork offers many leisure opportunities and
                            sporting facilities together with a peaceful pace of life. This area provides some of the finest sailing along the entire south coast,
                            whilst golf is catered for at Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Bantry. There is excellent fishing by arrangement on the Rivers Ilen, Argideen
                            and Bandon. Sandy Blue Flag beaches are to be found at Inchydoney, Rosscarbery and Tragumna.</p>
