### Further testing:
I asked friends and family to look at the site on their devices and report any issues they find.

They reported some minor spacing propoblem on mobil size I solve this to adding margins and paddings

In final testing some issue occured:

<img src="assets/img/TESTING.md-img/34.png" width="500" alt="image">

That issue is on the pages when the page use this Swiper bundle.
Spoke with my mentor Akshat Garg he told me the problem is not in my code, this is the problem on their end.

<img src="assets/img/TESTING.md-img/35.png" width="500" alt="image">

That problem was on Home, Local properties and Properties Abroad pages. Those page doesn't needed the proprties.js file.
To solve this problem I delete the properties.js script file of those page.
