The yard buildings are of different stone with some brick and were apparently constructed at different stages. Though altered, extended and modified over the year, so it is interesting to describe in a number of buys, the house retains the character of a house over two hundred years old, and has unusual features such as a rounded brick oven in the side of the kitchen fire opening, and a hidden passage way to permit the servants to pass unobtrusively from the kitchen to the dinning room."],

Located adjacent to Glandore village, yet commands an unrivalled elevated situation overlooking the harbour with breath-taking southerly views to Adam & Eve islands, the coastline and ocean. Originally built c. 1760, Stone Hall was completely renovated and extended in the early 1990's. This imposing house, along with The Rectory and Seamark, forms a group of three distinct houses sharing similar design traits such as the advanced end bays. Stone Hall appears to be the earliest house of the group, while the others were built by members of the Allen family within its grounds. The grandeur of the house is accentuated by its raised location and prominent position. The residence, having undergone such a comprehensive restoration encompassing major refurbishment to all facets of the building structure, is in excellent condition throughout marrying the charm of a Georgian property with all the convenience of modern living. Great care was taken to enhance and retain its period features. Stone Hall measuring approx. 5,000 sq. Ft (465 sq m) offers bright and airy accommodation of generous proportions. Upon entry it is remarkably elegant, behind the large front door there is a beautifully proportioned entrance hall with stone flagged flooring, ceiling cornicing and a wonderfully ornate ceiling rose. The drawing room and dining room both have polished oak timber flooring, attractive marble chimney pieces with built-in gas fires and splendid cornicing and ceiling roses. At the western end, there is a warm and homely family day room with open hearth fireplace with wood burning stove, impressive windows, large sliding door opening to sun terrace and polished timber floor. The kitchen/breakfast room is an elegant and welcoming space with door leading to the walled garden and service hatch connecting to the dining room. At the eastern end, there is a self-contained guest apartment including living room, kitchenette, bedroom and shower room. On the half landing, there is an en-suite guest bedroom while the first floor comprises of the master bedroom suite including an en-suite bathroom and dressing area. There are two more en-suite bedrooms on the same floor and all but one of the bedrooms take advantage of the majestic coastal view. On the second floor, there are three further bedrooms and a separate family bathroom. Approached by a private electronic gated entrance through an immaculate lawned garden, the drive slowly inclines to the front approach with limestone steps leading to the front door and sun terrace. The gardens are a wonderful and particular feature of the property offering stunning views over Glandore harbour including a summer house and a wide variety of temperate climate loving trees and shrubs leading down to the edge of the property. Beyond the public road, there is significant water frontage. Hidden to the rear of the house lies a most enchanting tiered garden with a beautiful curved wall encasing it. This walled garden has a sublime aesthetic value but also retains its original and very valuable function: To raise the temperature of the garden and provide a more protective environment for the plants within. The remainder of the grounds are laid out in woodland. The location itself needs little introduction. Glandore (Harbour of the Oaks) is acclaimed as one of the most scenic villages in Ireland. This much sought-after village is set in a superb position at the head of a spectacular natural wooded harbour and enjoys an easy-going cosmopolitan atmosphere, with residents drawn from around the globe. The village has pubs and restaurants whilst the nearby fishing village of Union Hall, reached across the iron harbour bridge, provides a shop as well as further restaurants and pubs. Glandore has a delightful sheltered harbour with much year-round on the water activity including sailing school, sea angling, whale watching, rowing championships and regattas. Further along The Wild Atlantic Way, Skibbereen market town is circa 11 km away with extensive shopping and banking facilities and includes a popular country market. Cork International Airport is approximately one hour distant. West Cork offers many leisure opportunities and sporting facilities together with a peaceful pace of life. This area provides some of the finest sailing along the entire south coast, whilst golf is catered for at Skibbereen, Clonakilty and Bantry. There is excellent fishing by arrangement on the Rivers Ilen, Argideen and Bandon. Sandy Blue Flag beaches are to be found at Inchydoney, Rosscarbery and Tragumna."],

        description: ["21-bedroom hotel & Bar/Restaurant with private marina on c. 2 acres The 21-bedroom Sherkin Island Hotel provides a rare opportunity to purchase a commercially run hotel on one of Ireland's inhabited islands, a stopping off point on the Wild Atlantic Way, and just ten minutes by regular ferry to the mainland. This property has a truly breath-taking coastal aspect. The hotel provides a wide range of room types including double, family, twin & standard rooms. Key Features: Sherkin House is sitting on Sherkin island just off the West Cork coast. There are only -50 permanent residents on the island. It is directly accessible by boat to the private marina.

It measures 3 miles long by 1.5 miles wide (5 km by 3 km). With regular ferry services to the island from Baltimore harbour village, this inshore island is in one of the most scenic coastal areas of Ireland. It has a number of beautiful beaches such as Silver Strand, just 1.5 miles from the property. Sherkin has its own special character. A West Cork anecdote has it that Sherkin's residents live off their art: Island craft, paintings and book writing all inspired by Sherkin's tranquil lifestyle. Dining/Bar: The hotel has a fully fitted commercial kitchen that serves the pub & restaurant (which has a 7-day trading license) and function rooms, making it an ideal location for small weddings, birthday parties etc. Marina: With the added benefit of a marina attached, one of few marinas between Kinsale and Dingle on the south-western coast, it is an essential stop off for anyone sailing this coastline. It also attracts a number of local day trips during the summer months who want to enjoy the beauty of the island and visit its wonderful beaches. The surrounding waters are renowned for boating, sailing and other water activities such as whale & dolphin watching and the famous Fastnet Lighthouse is just 9 miles away.

That’s exactly the appeal: Boraston House, as it’s known, is completely secluded while less than a 10-minute drive to the center of the city. A private drive at the end of a quiet lane in Ravelston, a suburb of Edinburgh, leads to the grand, three-story stone mansion and two-acre gardens. Ravelston Golf Club surrounds Boraston on two sides, while the trees of Hillwood Park create a wild forest wall around the rest of the property line, images of the home show. The front facade is marked by two prominent bays and a steep gable roof with dormer windows. A vestibule with original flagstone flooring leads into an entrance hall off of which are all of the home’s reception rooms, including an 800-square-foot drawing room. There’s also a glass-enclosed conservatory, sitting room, study and dining room. An open kitchen with Shaker-style units steps down into a sunken informal dining space with painted exposed stone walls. Eight bedrooms are spread across the top two floors of the house, in addition to a family room on the second level. The master suite includes a dressing room and en-suite bathroom. The house retains much of its period character, including numerous fireplaces, ornate plasterwork and leaded windows. There’s also a standalone summerhouse, a gazebo of sorts, that sits at the edge of the propertyline overlooking the golf course, according to the listing. The tranquil refuge is surrounded by colorful flower beds of peonies, honeysuckle, lavender, azaleas and roses."],
